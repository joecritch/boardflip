# BoardFlip.js

Here's a very early experiment, attempting to recreate a flipboard-style effect with CSS3 and JavaScript.

It's pretty buggy at the minute, and there's not much exposed to the API. I'll hopefully have chance to work on it again soon.

## To-do

* Allow to directly skip to a particular page
* Give the user an indication of how to use the flipboard (on intro)
* Add shadow effects
* Make responsive for mobile devices
* Make a demo showcasing other DOM elements (not just images)
